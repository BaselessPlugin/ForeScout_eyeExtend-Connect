# Sepio Connector for Forescout

## Overview

The **Sepio Connector for Forescout** enhances Forescout’s network visibility and control by integrating **Sepio's hardware asset risk intelligence** directly into the Forescout platform. This integration enables security teams to enforce Zero Trust policies by validating the authenticity and trustworthiness of all connected devices—down to the physical layer.

With Sepio’s unique **AssetDNA™** technology, Forescout users gain unparalleled visibility into connected assets, including rogue, spoofed, or unauthorized hardware. This integration helps mitigate hardware-based threats, reduce attack surfaces, and strengthen compliance across IT, OT, and IoT environments.

## Key Features

- Enhanced Asset Visibility  
  Leverage Sepio’s physical-layer intelligence to detect all hardware assets—including unmanaged, shadow, and rogue devices.

- Zero Trust Hardware Access  
  Continuously validate device integrity to enforce access policies based on real device identity, not just logical credentials.

- Rogue Device Detection & Mitigation  
  Instantly detect and respond to hardware-based attacks such as network implants (e.g., passive taps) and spoofed peripherals.

- Policy-Driven Automation  
  Enrich Forescout’s policy engine with Sepio’s asset context for automated responses to risk conditions and non-compliant assets.

## Use Cases

- Prevent Hardware-Based MITM Attacks: Detect devices like rogue switches or passive taps introduced into the network.
- Control Unmanaged Peripherals: Identify and restrict unauthorized USB or PCI-connected hardware on endpoints.
- Improve Compliance and Auditing: Maintain accurate asset inventory with physical-layer verification for regulatory alignment.
