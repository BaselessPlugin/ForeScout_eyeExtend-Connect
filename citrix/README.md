## Known Issues

* This app has not been tested in a multi-tenant environment.
* If you trigger a manual Discovery of hosts via the Connect module refresh options against a large SD-WAN environment the GUI may show a timeout error.  The discovery is still running and will update hosts when complete.

### Refreshing Discovery of Hosts

Use the refresh button to manual poll for endpoints and VPN users.
